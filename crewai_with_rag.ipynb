            "Microservices architecture is a modern approach to software development where applications are broken down into small independent components. Kubernetes was designed to manage, deploy and scale applications built this way. This article explores the pros and cons of microservices and explains why Kubernetes is an excellent tool for the job. First developed by a team at Google and later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes, commonly referred to as K8s, stands as an open-source container orchestration system for ... This page describes running Kubernetes across multiple zones. Background Kubernetes is designed so that a single Kubernetes cluster can run across multiple failure zones, typically where these zones fit within a logical grouping called a region. Major cloud providers define a region as a set of failure zones (also called availability zones) that provide a consistent set of features: within a ... It uses Cloud Run to deploy a similar online shop application without the need for Kubernetes, and doesn't use microservices. This document assumes that you're familiar with basic cloud concepts, though not necessarily Google Cloud. Experience with Terraform is helpful. Note: This solution helps you explore the capabilities of Google Cloud. The ... Simplified Deployment. Kubernetes simplifies the deployment of microservices by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure complexities. It operates on a cluster of nodes where each node can host multiple containers. Kubernetes uses declarative configuration to define how applications should run and maintain their desired state.\n",
